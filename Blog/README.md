The ***John Doe's blog*** was developed during my training at the [3W Academy](https://3wa.fr/) (summer 2018). The exercise was to create a writer's blog, with the following features:

### User's side

- display articles and comments
- possibility to write comments

### Admin's side

- write articles
- edit / delete articles

## Author and license

If you have comments, corrections, complaints, or ideas for improvements, feel free to send me a message.
